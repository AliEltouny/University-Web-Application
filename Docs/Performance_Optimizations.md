# Performance Optimizations for Community Feature

This document tracks the performance optimizations implemented for the **Community Creation** feature in the application.

---

## 1. Image Compression (Client-Side)

**Status:** Implemented

**Description:** Client-side image compression is applied to reduce the size of uploaded images before they are sent to the server.

**Implementation:**

* Integrated `browser-image-compression` library.
* Added `compressImage` function in the `MediaUpload` component that:

  * Compresses images to 80% of the max allowed size or 2MB, whichever is smaller.
  * Limits image dimensions to 1920px for width/height while maintaining aspect ratio.
  * Uses web workers to enhance performance.
* Modified `handleFileChange` function to compress images before uploading.
* Improved user experience by showing a preview immediately while compression happens in the background.

**Expected Benefits:**

* Reduces upload bandwidth (30-70% smaller file sizes).
* Decreases server load for image processing.
* Improves upload speed and success rates.
* Reduces storage requirements on the server.

**Metrics:**

* Logged original image size in the console.
* Logged compressed image size in the console.

## 2. Form Validation Optimization

**Status:** Implemented

**Description:** Debouncing is implemented for form validation to avoid unnecessary validation checks during user input.

**Implementation:**

* Added `lodash` library for debouncing functionality.
* Created a custom `debouncedValidation` function with a 300ms delay.
* Utilized `registerWithDebounce` utility for form fields.
* Set form validation mode to "onChange" for live validation.
* Introduced `formChanged` ref to prevent initial unnecessary validation.

**Expected Benefits:**

* Reduces CPU usage during form completion.
* Improves form responsiveness while typing.
* Prevents validation flickering for fast typists.
* Provides timely feedback to users without unnecessary checks.

**Metrics:**

* Validation triggers after the user stops typing (debounced after 300ms).

## 3. Image Cropper Performance

**Status:** Implemented

**Description:** Optimized image cropping by creating a resized preview for better performance.

**Implementation:**

* Added size limits for preview images (800x600 max dimensions).
* Used canvas-based image resizing to reduce memory usage.
* Implemented a loading state to provide feedback during image processing.
* Improved output quality for cropped images (95% JPEG quality).
* Added error handling for better reliability.

**Expected Benefits:**

* Reduced memory usage when cropping large images.
* Enhanced cropping performance on lower-end devices.
* Prevented UI freezing during large image processing.
* Provided visual feedback during image crop.

**Metrics:**

* Logged preview size reduction.
* Improved error handling for robustness.

## 4. API Performance Optimization

**Status:** Implemented

**Description:** Optimized the API communication for community creation to enhance performance and reliability.

**Implementation:**

* Improved the `FormData` creation process in `communityApi.ts`.
* Separated text and image field processing for better performance.
* Added performance timers to track bottlenecks.
* Implemented progress monitoring via `onUploadProgress`.
* Increased timeout for image uploads to handle slower connections.
* Optimized cache clearing with `setTimeout` to prevent UI blocking.

**Expected Benefits:**

* Faster form submission with improved resource utilization.
* More reliable image uploads, especially for larger files.
* Better performance monitoring with timing data.
* Reduced memory usage during form submission.

**Metrics:**

* Logged API request timing data.
* Logged upload progress percentage.
* Logged overall execution time of `createCommunity` function.

## 5. Form Submission UX Improvements

**Status:** Implemented

**Description:** Enhanced form submission to provide better visual feedback and improve perceived performance.

**Implementation:**

* Introduced `submissionProgress` state to track submission progress.
* Added a progress bar to the submit button for visual feedback.
* Created a backup of form data in `sessionStorage` as a safety measure.
* Added performance timing metrics to monitor submission speed.
* Disabled form controls during submission to prevent double-submission.

**Expected Benefits:**

* Improved user experience through clear progress indication.
* Better perceived performance with feedback during submission.
* Form data backup for potential submission errors.
* Prevented accidental multiple submissions.

**Metrics:**

* Logged total submission time in the console.
* Displayed submission progress percentage visually.

## Upcoming Optimizations

### 6. Modularize Large Component

* **Status:** Pending
* **Description:** Refactor the large `CreateCommunityForm` component into smaller, more manageable components for better maintainability and performance.

### 7. Server-Side Image Optimization

* **Status:** Pending
* **Description:** Implement server-side image optimization using Django's **Pillow** library to further compress images upon upload.

### 8. Database Optimizations

* **Status:** Pending
* **Description:** Optimize database transactions in `CommunityCreateSerializer` to reduce unnecessary database overhead.

### 9. Media Storage Optimization

* **Status:** Pending
* **Description:** Implement cloud storage (e.g., Amazon S3) for media files with a CDN to optimize storage and delivery performance.

### 10. Caching Improvements

* **Status:** Pending
* **Description:** Introduce **Redis** cache for community list and detail views to reduce load time and database queries.

### 11. Async Processing for Media

* **Status:** Pending
* **Description:** Integrate **Celery** for asynchronous image processing to handle media files in the background without blocking the main thread.

### 12. Reduce API Payload Size

* **Status:** Pending
* **Description:** Return only essential data from the server after community creation to reduce API payload size and improve performance.

### 13. Implement Rate Limiting

* **Status:** Pending
* **Description:** Add rate limiting to the community creation endpoint to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources.

### 14. Performance Monitoring

* **Status:** Pending
* **Description:** Implement server-side timing metrics for the entire community creation process to identify performance bottlenecks.
